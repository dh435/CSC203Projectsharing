Project 1: Basic Space Game


Project 1 was an Object-Oriented program that served a basic game. 
It was written in Java, and consisted of us using various methods of program development. 
We also made use of the aspects of Object-Oriented design.

The Game was a simple simulation of a 'mothership' which is being chased across space by several UFOs.
These UFOs would spawn from the red 'alien' worlds you can see. The main obstacles here were the asteroids scattered across the map.
The UFOs would try to locate the mothership by using a A-star Pathing Algorithm.  

I will not be submitting my Source code here.
